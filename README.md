# Secure File Sharing Application  

This repository contains a **Client-Side E2EE secure file-sharing web application** designed for safe, efficient file uploads, downloads, and sharing.

---

## ðŸš€ First-Time Setup  

Follow these steps to set up and run the application:  

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash  
git clone https://github.com/mayankramina/secure-file-share.git  
cd secure-file-share  
```  

### 2. Generate self-signed SSL Certificates

```bash  
# Create necessary directories  
mkdir -p frontend/certs backend/certs  

# Generate a single SSL certificate (its a looong command. please scroll towards right and copy complete command)
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout temp_key.pem -out temp_cert.pem -days 365 -nodes -subj "/C=US/ST=State/L=City/O=Organization/CN=localhost" -addext "subjectAltName = DNS:localhost,IP:127.0.0.1" 

# Copy the certificate and key to both frontend and backend  
cp temp_key.pem frontend/certs/key.pem  
cp temp_cert.pem frontend/certs/cert.pem  
cp temp_key.pem backend/certs/key.pem  
cp temp_cert.pem backend/certs/cert.pem  

# Remove temporary files  
rm temp_key.pem temp_cert.pem  
```  

### 3. Run the Application

```bash  
# Build and start the application  
docker-compose up --build  

# To run in detached mode:  
docker-compose up -d --build  
```  

### 4. Configure the Database and Admin User

```bash  
# Access the backend container  
docker-compose exec backend bash  

# Apply database migrations  
python manage.py migrate  

# Create a superuser (follow the prompts to set username and password)  
python manage.py createsuperuser  

# Exit the container  
exit  
```  

### 5. Access the Application

- **Frontend**: [https://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000)  
- **Backend**: [https://localhost:8000](https://localhost:8000)  
- **Admin Panel**: [https://localhost:8000/admin/](https://localhost:8000/admin/) (Ensure the trailing `/` is included)

## ðŸŒŸ Key Features  

### âœ… **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**  
Supports browser-session-specific TOTP-based MFA (e.g., Google Authenticator).  

### âœ… **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**  
- **Admin**: Full control over users and files ([Admin Panel](https://localhost:8000/admin/)).  
- **Regular User**: Upload, download, and share files.  
- **Guest**: Download and view the shared files.  

### âœ… **Client-Side End-to-End File Encryption**  
- Files are encrypted during transmission and at rest on a server with AES-256.
- File encryption and file decryption for user and shared users are managed from the client side.
- This is achieved with a key management system to encrypt the AES-256 encryption key with RSA-2048.
- KMS takes care of the decryption of the AES-256 encryption key and distribution of decryption capabilities by providing server-side access to RSA keys to other users.
- KMS has been added to replicate a trusted key management system, unlike the traditional server-side key management system.

### âœ… **Secure File Sharing**  
- Share files with specific users with configurable **view** or **download** permissions.  
- Generate one-time, secure links with expiration.

## ðŸ”’ Security Best Practices  

- âœ… SSL/TLS for secure connections. HTTPS traffic with self-signed certificates for local development.
- âœ… JWT-based authentication with secure and HttpOnly cookies.  
- âœ… Strong password hashing using bcrypt. 
- âœ… Input validation and sanitization to prevent malicious data entry.  
- âœ… Proper session management with JWT expiration.  

## Custom Configuration
- Custom configuration for many of the above features are present in ```backend/core/settings.py```

## Known Issues & Limitations
- Storing files on server machine: can switch to solutions like s3 for better file storage
- No file integrity verification mechanism
- No file chunking large files are held in memory during encryption/decryption
- Limited audit logging
- No password reset functionality
- No case conversion on UI (snake case to camel case)
